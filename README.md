# Morphoglyph

Editor for glyph-based visualisation of cell morphology features.
https://morphoglyph.web.app/#/
Visual elements in the glyphs vary linearly with the feature values, after normalisation across the datasets.
This software provides a solution to the visualisation of many different morphological characteristics at once.
